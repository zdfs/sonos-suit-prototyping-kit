Sonos Suit Prototyping Kit
==============

This is the Sonos Suit prototyping kit. To install, clone the repo or download the zip file to your computer.
Run `npm install` and the project will install all of the appropriate dependencies. If you want to host your pages on
Github, be sure to update "homepage" url in the `package.json` file with your Github pages url or whatever url
you desire.

After installing your dependencies, you can run the `grunt` command to start the local server.

To enable LiveReload, in a separate terminal window, run `grunt watch`.

To generate HTML for a static upload to a server or GitHub pages, run `grunt deploy`.
